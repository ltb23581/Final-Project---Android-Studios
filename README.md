Created for CSCI 4060 (Mobile Software Development), the Roommate Shopping App is an Android application designed to facilitate the management of shared shopping lists and expenses for roommates living in the same household. By using this app, roommates can collaboratively maintain a shopping list, track purchases, and fairly split expenses. The app leverages Googleâ€™s Firebase for real-time data sharing and storage, ensuring that all roommates have access to the latest updates.
